# F-16A Demo
========

A howto-module for DCS: World about high fidelity flight dynamics and advanced systems modeling. 
Originally created by CptSmiley. 3D work done by SkateZilla.

Flight model source code:
Use Only for Non-Commercial Purposes

3D model:
Do NOT Use the External 3D model or Cockpit Model EDMs outside of this Module.
Anyone Caught Moving the 3D External/Cockpit EDMs to Private/Hacked/Jury Rigged Mods, 
Even for Personal Use will be dealt with harsely as it violates the license Agreements for the 3D Assets.
So Once Again, Do NOT use the 3D Model EDMs with any private Mods.
